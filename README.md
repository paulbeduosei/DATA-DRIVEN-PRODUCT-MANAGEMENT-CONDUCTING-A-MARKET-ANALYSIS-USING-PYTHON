# DATA-DRIVEN-PRODUCT-MANAGEMENT-CONDUCTING-A-MARKET-ANALYSIS-USING-SQL
Completed a Python market analysis project as a “product manager” for a fitness studio — and it turned into a fascinating deep dive into global demand for digital fitness classes 💻📈

Using Google Trends data from multiple CSV files, I explored how interest in fitness keywords varies across countries, seasons, and product types. The goal was to identify where demand for digital fitness products is growing fastest — and where new offerings could have the biggest impact.

This project helped me combine market analysis, data wrangling, and product strategy — and it reinforced how valuable data can be when making decisions about digital services and growth opportunities.
